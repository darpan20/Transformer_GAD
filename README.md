# Transformer_GAD


The implementation of Transformer model using Pytorch Lightning for Group anomaly detection on trajectory datasets as a part of the Master thesis. The performance is compared and imrpoved with respect to GRU (Gated Recuurent Unit) RNN in unsupervised, semisupervised as well as supervised scenarios
