# Transformer_GAD


The implementation of Transformer model using Pytorch Lightning for Group anomaly detection on trajectory datasets as a part of the Master thesis. The performance is compared and imrpoved with respect to GRU (Gated Recuurent Unit) RNN in unsupervised, semisupervised as well as supervised scenarios. The code contains the implementations to answer the two research questions 'rq1' and 'rq2' as part of the thesis :

1. rq1: How is it possible to improve the Group Anomaly Detection per-
formance with Transformers?
2. rq2: How is it possible to quantify the Group Anomaly score with a
Transformer?
